# Imadu‑style Portfolio (Clone‑like, not identical)

A modern, animated portfolio built with **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion**.
This is an original template inspired by popular portfolio UIs—no third‑party content or assets copied.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Customize

- Edit content in `src/components/*`.
- Replace SVG placeholders with your images in the Gallery/Hero.
- Colors are under `tailwind.config.js` (`brand` scale).
- The contact form is static—wire it up to your backend or a service.

## Notes
- This project avoids copying any proprietary text/images from the referenced site.
- You can deploy to Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare in minutes.
